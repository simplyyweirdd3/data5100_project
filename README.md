**Predictive Modeling of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Stroke**

**Team Members: Ruman Sidhu, Devlin Hoang**

**Subject: DATA 5100**


**Overview**

This project uses three open-source Kaggle datasets to build and compare predictive models for major health outcomes: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.
Our goal is to identify key risk factors and evaluate machine learning models that can support early detection and prevention efforts.
The final deliverable will include Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling, a cleaned dataset version, and a simple demo for interactive prediction.

**Purpose**

Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and stroke are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction using health indicators can help in timely interventions.
We aim to create interpretable, accurate models and visualize the most influential risk factors for each disease.

**Data**

We use **three datasets** from Kaggle:
Diabetes Prediction Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
Cardiovascular Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/manarmohamed24/cardiovascular-disease/input
Stroke Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdullahkse/stroke-data-eda/input
Each dataset contains health and demographic information such as age, gender, BMI, glucose levels, smoking status, and blood pressure. These will be preprocessed and analyzed separately.
